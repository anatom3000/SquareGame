# SquareGame

pygame implementation of the popular ~~$2 square game~~ rythm-based platformer Geometry Dash.

The end goal is to be able to load Stereo Madness by reading the original level data.
Physics and camera movements are implemented to be as close as the real game as possible, although they may not be 100% accurate.
